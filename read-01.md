#### Article 1: Shay Howe’s intro to RWD

**Responsive Overview**
Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

**Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile**

**Responsive** generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while **adaptive** means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change.
**Mobile**, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.


**Flexible Layouts**

**Flexible layouts**, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or `em` units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as `width`, `margin`, or `padding`.
Flexible layouts *do not* advocate the use of fixed measurement units, such as pixels or inches.
